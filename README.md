#### Basic Question

I want to catch a baseball at a baseball game. Where should I sit?

11/16

- Added webscraping roster functionality
- Isolated teams by home game and home runs

11/28

- Beginning to reference Alan Nathan's implementation
- Talked to David to figure out calculations
- found velocity and spin values in each direction

12/1

- finished successfully calculating velocity and accleration of each direction

12/3

- able to iterate and find trajectory of a given row in the database
- able to simulate it for each time step

12/12

- fixed trajectory
- refactored and reorganized a bunch of code

TO DO:

- figure out classifications for each section
- make function that tests when trajectories intersect with those boundaries
